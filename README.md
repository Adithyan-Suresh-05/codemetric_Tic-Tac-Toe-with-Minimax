As a part of my internship program at codemetric, this is one of my project called Tic Tac Toe with Minimax [x or o].


#  Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax AI – Python Tkinter Game

A fun and challenging **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built using **Python's Tkinter GUI** and powered by the **Minimax algorithm**.  
You play against an unbeatable AI that always makes the optimal move!

##  Features

- 🎯 Human vs AI gameplay
- 🧠 AI uses the Minimax algorithm for unbeatable strategy
- 🎨 Built-in score tracking (Player vs Computer)
- 🔁 Option to choose your symbol (X or O)
- 🌟 Highlights the winning combination
- 🪄 Clean, user-friendly GUI using Tkinter

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tictactoe-minimax.git
   cd tictactoe-minimax
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python tictactoe_minimax.py


📚 How It Works
The game initializes a 3x3 board using Tkinter buttons.

The player chooses X or O at the start.

After the player’s move, the computer calculates its best move using the Minimax algorithm.

The game continues until there is a win or a draw.

Scores are updated dynamically
